  about:
    - question: What is threshold cryptography?
      answer: Threshold cryptography is a revolutionary technology that uses
        cryptography to unlock greater utility and usability for digital assets
        without needing to trust a centralized party. Threshold cryptography
        distributes sensitive operations across multiple independent entities –
        like nodes in a network – and requires a threshold, or minimum number of
        those entities to cooperate for the operation to be successful.

    - question: Do legacy KEEP stakers need to set up a PRE node?
      answer: Yes, everyone who stakes on Threshold will need to run a PRE node. If
        you are working with a stakng provider, reach out to them to accomplish
        this. If you are running your own node, you can refer to the following
        guide.
