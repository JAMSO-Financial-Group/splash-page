    - question: Do legacy KEEP stakers need to set up a PRE node?
      answer:
        Yes, everyone who stakes on Threshold will need to run a PRE node. If
        you are working with a stakng provider, reach out to them to accomplish
        this. If you are running your own node, you can refer to the following
        guide.

    - question: What determines the exchange rate for T tokens?
      answer:
        As decided by the NU and KEEP communities in the final merge proposal,
        the conversion ratio for each token is based on the total supply rather
        than price. The final total supply of NU is ~1,380,688,920 and the total
        supply of KEEP is ~940,795,010. As a result, the token factors are
        1NU:~3.26T and 1KEEP:~4.78T.

    - question: How did Keep and NuCypher merge?
      answer:
        The Keep and NuCypher communities voted to merge into a single network
        in the RC0 T Token proposal. This resulted in the first ever
        decentralized on-chain network merger and launched Threshold Network.
        The merger resulted in the introduction of a new token (T), the
        Threshold DAO,  and the Threshold Discord server.
